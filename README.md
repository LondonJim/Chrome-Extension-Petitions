# Random Petitions Chrome Extension

I had an idea to create a chrome extension that related to the government petition site and getting more people become active in so much as signing more petitions. Currently on clicking the icon a popup occurs with a random currently open and active petition. It displays the current signature count and gives the user an option to visit the page of the specific petition and the option to see the next random petition.

The idea is to publish on the chrome extension store for free once complete.

## Installation

`git clone git@github.com:LondonJim/Chrome-Extension-Petitions.git`

Currently to install you will have to enter developer mode on your chrome extensions page.

`chrome://extensions` to access page

Toggle Developer Mode on the right hand side

Click on Load unpacked and select the folder of the extension

## In progress

```
As a user,
So I can see relevant petitions,
The petitions are based on a current news item I'm viewing.
```

This would involve matching petition title text and petition paragraph text to the current page news item text. Most likely the user will see petitions that are completely against what they believe but hopefully some will resonate with them!
